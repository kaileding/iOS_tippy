## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [√] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [√] UI animations
* [√] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [√] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [√] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [√] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
    1. Animated subview of split bills for a number of people, use buttons to alter the number of people who will share the bill
    2. Changing color theme when keyboard shows up or hides
    3. Add setting item for default number of people who will share the bill, the setting control uses a continuous slider
    4. Auto-correct textfield typings (converts "" to "0", "05" to "5", "0.578" to "0.57", etc.) besides adding thousands separators.
